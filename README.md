Welcome to my Portfolio!

Thanks for checking out my Portfolio project! So far I have added a few projects using all the responsive web design skills I have learned up to this point (Flexbox rules!!!). You can find it at www.coryrunnells.com.

My goal for the design of this website was to keep it simple, show off what I have been learning, and have a place to be creative. As I learn more, I plan to make updates along the way. JavaScript projects now added!

Let me know what you think! You can find me on Twitter @CoryRunn, or you can email me at cory.runnells@gmail.com.
